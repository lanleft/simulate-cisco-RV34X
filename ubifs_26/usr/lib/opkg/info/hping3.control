Description:  hping is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer. The interface is
 inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping isn't only able to send ICMP echo
 requests. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW-IP protocols, has a traceroute mode, the
 ability to send files between a covered channel, and many other features.
